	1. Recap 
	2. Variables---> is a container which can store the data 
		data stored in it
		1. Global variable
			a. declared at class level with static 			keyword.
			b. can be accessed entire class freely.
		2. Instance Variable
			a. declared at class level without static 			keyword.
			b. can be accesses entire class based on 			instance
		3. Local variable
			a. declared inside method.
			b. cannot cross the method. Will stay inside 			the method only 
	3. dataTypes
		1. Premitive datatype
			a. byte     numbers from the range -128 to 128
					byte abc=30;
					1 byte of memory	
			b. short
				which is also dealing with numbers  -32000 to +32000                          2 bytes 
					short s=3000;	
			c. int
				is a datatype dealing with numbers from range ~-2cr to ~+2cr              4 bytes
					int aba=10000;
			d. long  8 bytes
				is also dealing with numbers from range with big numbers                  long l=9999999999999l;
			-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

			e. float  	1.40239846e-45f to 3.40282347e+38f                   float f=33.23f; 
			f. double       double d=21341243214.324234;
			g. char  char ch='a';
				 ch='D';
			h. boolean  boolean bool=true/false;
		2. non-premitive datatype
			a. class
			b. object
			c. Arrays
			d. String	
			e. StringBuffer and StringBuiders

	4. Static non static (we also need to understand object mechanisim)


	Assignment
		1. Create local variables and print all the variables in console
		2. Create global variables and print all the variables in different method but not in main method and call in main method.
		3. Create Global variable and print in main method before that change the values in another method and see the impact.
